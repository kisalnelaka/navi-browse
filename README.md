# 🎮 Gesture-Based Website Navigation (Work in Progress) 🚀

A **web-based navigation system** controlled by **hand gestures**, using **TensorFlow.js and HandPose model** to detect movements via webcam. Navigate **left/right** between pages and **up/down** between sections—all **hands-free!** 🖐️✨

> **⚠️ Work in Progress:** This project is under active development! More features and improvements are coming soon. 🚧

## 📌 Features
✅ **Gesture-Based Navigation** (Swipe left/right for pages, up/down for sections)  
✅ **Webcam Hand Detection** (Powered by TensorFlow.js)  
✅ **Material UI Styling** (Modern, sleek design)  
✅ **Debug Mode** (Shows hand detection status)  
✅ **Optimized Gesture Handling** (Prevents accidental double navigation-wip)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kisalnelaka/navi-browse.git
   cd navi-browse
### 2️⃣ Open `index.html` in a browser
- Use Chrome for better webcam permissions.  
- No server required! Just open the file.  

---

## 🎥 How It Works
1. Allow webcam access (Prompt appears when opening the page).  
2. Perform hand gestures in front of the camera:  
   - 👈 Swipe Left: Move to the **next page**  
   - 👉 Swipe Right: Move to the **previous page**  
   - ☝️ Swipe Up: Move to the **previous section**  
   - 👇 Swipe Down: Move to the **next section**  
3. Check Debug Info (Bottom-left) to see detection status.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Improve Accuracy (Fine-tuning threshold values)  
- Add More Gestures (Pinch-to-Zoom, Double Tap, etc.)  
- Enhance Mobile Support (Better responsiveness for phones/tablets)  
- Settings Panel (Customize gesture sensitivity)  
- Voice Commands (Hybrid navigation with gestures + voice)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow.js (Hand tracking)  
- **HandPose Model:** Gesture recognition  
- **Design:** Material UI
